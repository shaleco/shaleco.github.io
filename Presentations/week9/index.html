    <h1>Task 2</h1>

    <p>
      I would prefer that yellow was not used as a header font because it was very hard to read against a white background. I think using a darker color like dark blue or green would have worked better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think showing an example of the git hub critique was very useful in understanding what we had to do in the assignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the presentation would be better if larger font sizes were used on the cards, they were a little hard to read. Making the font size between 18-20 would have been better.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Task 3
    </h1>

    <p>
      I think that having the font colour of the header would be better as white so it stands out against the red background. this would make it easier to read
    </p>
    <p>
      Making the body font all the same colour will make it look more cohesive and easier to read. I would reccomend making it white
    </p>
    <p>
      I would reccommend making the nav bar black to draw more attention to it and make the links inside white to stand out better.
