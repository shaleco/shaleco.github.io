        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Download Atom, Create a Github account and download "Github for desktop".
            </li>
            <li>
                After you have all the necessairy software downloaded you will need to create a new repository within the Github website. This repository should be titled "yourusername.github.io"
            </li>
            <li>
                After you have downloaded the Github for desktop software you will need to sign in with your GitHub account.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are now going to need to clone the repository you created online to your computer. There are two ways to do this:
                <ol class="list2">
                    <li>
                        The first way is to go to the repository that you created online, press the green button labeled "clone or download" Select open in desktop, the repository will then open in your desktop application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second way is to open the Github Desktop software, press the "+" symbol in the upper left hand corner. Then tab to the clone option and select your desired repository from the list. You may be prompted to choose a save location, be sure to choose
                        something that is easily accessable.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                After you have cloned your repository you will need to test whether or not everything is working properly. Open Atom and create a new index.html file. Save it in the location of your new cloned github repository. Create a simple paragraph tag and type
                "hello world". Save it and then reopen the github desktop software. The "changes" tab at the top should show that you have one uncommitted change. Clicking on this tab will allow you to view Your code.
            </li>
            <li>
                The next step is to commit your changes. You do this by adding a summary of what changes were made and pressing "Commit to Master"
            </li>
            <li>
                The final step is to press the sync button, Your changes will now be visible on the GitHub Website.
            </li>
        </ol>
